# DaisyComponents

DaisyComponents is a Ruby gem that provides a collection of ViewComponents implementing the DaisyUI design system for Rails applications. It combines the power of ViewComponent, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI to create reusable, maintainable UI components.

## Features

- Built on top of ViewComponent for component-based architecture
- Implements DaisyUI's design system, based on TailwindCSS
- Live preview and documentation with [Lookbook](https://github.com/lookbook-hq/lookbook)
- Comprehensive test coverage with Minitest

## Installation

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

For new contributors or fresh environments, use the automated setup script:

```bash
$ ./bin/setup
```

This script will:
- Detect your OS and CPU architecture
- Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) if not already present
- Install Ruby 3.3.6 (required by the gemspec)
- Install Bundler if needed
- Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
- Provide clear instructions for using the environment

### Manual Setup

If you are using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for managing your development tools and environment, ensure you have it installed. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html).

Once mise is set up, you can install the required Ruby version (as specified in the `.tool-versions` file) by running:

```bash
$ mise install
```

Next, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "daisy_components"
```

And then execute to install the gem and other dependencies:
```bash
$ bundle install
```

## Usage
The component library includes Lookbook for development and documentation:

1. Start the development server:
```bash
$ bin/rails server
```

2. Visit http://localhost:3000/lookbook to see the component documentation and playground.

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
$ bin/rails test
```

With coverage:
```bash
$ COVERAGE=true bin/rails test
```

## Code Quality

### Trailing Newlines

Use the dedicated script to check and fix trailing newline issues:

```bash
# Check all files (excludes vendor/, node_modules/, tmp/, log/, coverage/, etc.)
$ ./bin/fix_trailing_newlines.sh --check-only

# Fix all files  
$ ./bin/fix_trailing_newlines.sh

# Check only staged files (used by git hooks)
$ ./bin/fix_trailing_newlines.sh --staged-only
```

### Git Hooks

A pre-commit hook is available that automatically performs code quality checks:

```bash
$ ./bin/setup_hooks.sh
```

The hook will run before each commit and will:
- âœ… **Fix trailing newlines** automatically in staged files
- ðŸ”§ **Run RuboCop** on staged Ruby files (will block commit if issues found)

**Note:** Git hooks are not automatically shared when cloning a repository. Each developer needs to run the setup script once after cloning.
