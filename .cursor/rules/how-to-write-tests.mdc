# Component Testing Structure

## Overview
Each component should have automated tests that verify both the component behavior and its preview examples. The `PreviewTestConcern` provides automated testing of all preview examples against their corresponding fixtures.

## Basic Test Structure
```ruby
module DaisyComponents
  module DataDisplay
    class CardComponentTest < DaisyComponents::ComponentTestCase
      include DaisyComponents::PreviewTestConcern

      # Test all preview examples automatically
      test_all_preview_examples(
        preview_class: CardComponentPreview,
        component_name: 'card',
        exclude: ['playground'] # Optional: exclude specific examples
      )


      # Additional component-specific tests...
      def test_complex_method
      #...
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## What Gets Tested
1. All preview methods (except playground) are automatically tested
2. Each preview's rendered output is compared against its fixture
3. HTML is normalized before comparison (classes, attributes, whitespace)
4. Failures indicate either:
   - Missing fixture file
   - Mismatch between preview output and fixture

## Test Organization
- Test files: `test/components/daisy_components/<module>/<component_name>_test.rb`
- Fixtures: `test/fixtures/components/<component_name>/<example_name>.html`
- NO: test files inside test/components/previews

## Best Practices
1. Always include `PreviewTestConcern`
2. Use `test_all_preview_examples` for comprehensive coverage
3. Add component-specific tests for behavior not covered by previews
4. Keep fixtures up to date with component changes
5. Don't duplicate preview tests unnecessarily
6. Give precedence to preview tests for visual examples
7. Focus component tests on behavior and edge cases

## Coverage Checking
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
COVERAGE=true bin/rails test

# Parse coverage report
./bin/parse_coverage.rb
```
```

This rule provides a clear structure for how component testing should be set up and what gets tested automatically through the `PreviewTestConcern`.
