# Playground Tests Added - Summary

## Overview
Added basic playground preview tests to ensure all component playground methods render correctly. This addresses the issue where some components had playground preview methods but no corresponding tests.

## Components Modified

### 1. Swap Component Test
**File:** `test/components/daisy_ui/actions/swap_test.rb`
**Added test:**
```ruby
# Begin playground preview tests
def test_playground_preview_default
  render_preview('playground')
  assert_selector 'input[type="checkbox"]', count: 1
  assert_selector '.swap', count: 1
  assert_text 'OFF'
end
```

### 2. Card Component Test  
**File:** `test/components/daisy_ui/data_display/card_test.rb`
**Added test:**
```ruby
# Begin playground preview tests
def test_playground_preview_default
  render_preview('playground')
  assert_selector '.card', count: 1
  assert_selector '.card-body', count: 1
  assert_text 'Card Title'
  assert_text 'Card content goes here.'
end
```

### 3. Badge Component Test
**File:** `test/components/daisy_ui/data_display/badge_test.rb`
**Added test:**
```ruby
# Begin playground preview tests
def test_playground_preview_default
  render_preview('playground')
  assert_selector '.badge', count: 1
  assert_text 'Badge'
end
```

### 4. Menu Component Test
**File:** `test/components/daisy_ui/navigation/menu_test.rb`
**Added test:**
```ruby
# Begin playground preview tests
def test_playground_preview_default
  render_preview('playground')
  assert_selector '.menu', count: 1
  assert_selector '.menu li', count: 3
  assert_text 'Home'
  assert_text 'Messages'
  assert_text 'Analytics'
end
```

## Components Already Having Playground Tests (No Changes Needed)

- **Button** - Has extensive playground tests
- **Dropdown** - Has extensive playground tests  
- **Avatar** - Has extensive playground tests
- **Accordion** - Has extensive playground tests
- **Chat** - Has extensive playground tests
- **Avatar Group** - Has extensive playground tests
- **Stack** - Has basic playground test
- **Navbar** - Has basic playground test
- **Breadcrumbs** - Has basic playground test

## Test Pattern Used

Each added test follows the established pattern:
1. Uses `render_preview('playground')` to render the playground method
2. Includes basic assertions to verify the component renders correctly
3. Checks for key CSS classes and text content
4. Follows the naming convention: `test_playground_preview_default`

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: All components with playground previews now have corresponding tests
- **Safety**: Ensures playground methods don't break during refactoring
- **Coverage**: Improves test coverage for preview functionality
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as documentation for expected playground behavior

## Note on Test Environment

The project requires Ruby 3.4.0+ but the environment has Ruby 3.3.7. The code changes have been made successfully, but full test execution would require upgrading Ruby to version 3.4.0 or later.
